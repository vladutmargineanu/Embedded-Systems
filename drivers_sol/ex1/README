Prequisites
-ARM toolchain is available in PATH with prefix 'arm-linux-gnueabihf-'
-sources and configuration for kernel running on target are available
-edit 'Makefile' to point 'KDIR' to your compiled kernel source directory

Solution
-run 'make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-'
-copy led_act.ko to target
-run on target as root 'insmod led_act.ko'
-run on target 'cat /proc/devices | grep led_act' and note the major number
-run on target 'mknod /dev/led_act c <major> 0'

Testing
-LED should be off
-running on target as root 'echo 1 > /dev/led_act' turns the LED on
-running on target as root 'cat /dev/led_act' returns 'on'
-running on target as root 'echo 0 > /dev/led_act' turns the LED off
-running on target as root 'cat /dev/led_act' returns 'off'
